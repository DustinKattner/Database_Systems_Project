# Database_Systems_Project
This project was created for my database class in University. It was developed primarily to demonstrate database use, but it also makes uses of node.js, 
handlebars, bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. This web app is intended to replicate the website of a local medical clinic, having options for patients, managers, and doctors.
Patients and Doctors are able to view upcoming appointments and manage them. Managers are able to create new doctor accounts as well as view appointments across all clinic
locations.

To access:
- Select main folder
- Locate and read READme file in main folder and follow its directions

** NOTE ** DB functionality does not work by creating a local instance of the website unless you also create a local instance of the DB and set it up. The website is published
at https://happylifeclinic.herokuapp.com
